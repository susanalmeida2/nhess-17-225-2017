10000 CHASM simulations used in www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/17/225/2017/

10 000 combinations of values for the 28 CHASM uncertain input factors used in paper www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/17/225/2017/
Such combinations were generated via random sampling from a set of probability distributions that characterize the uncertainty in the slope properties, and uniform distributions with very wide ranges for the intensity and duration of future rainfall events. More information on the distributions used available from www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/17/225/2017/
CHASM was run for the 10000 different combinations of input factors and the corresponding Factors of Safety, F, (model output) are also provided.
